Features include OpenWeatherMap api functionality for requesting current weather and forecast for any city
on earth, with a minimalist and consistent UI across two tabs. Weather can be refreshed from the main screen,
and background changes dynamically depending on the time of day at the location requested, combined with
separate icons for day and night.
